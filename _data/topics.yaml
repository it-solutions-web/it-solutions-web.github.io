      date: Dec 05, 2022
      body: |
        TI Solutions is part of the Innosuisse project “MRIcompLEAD". The project aims to develop novel leads for applications involving 
        neurostimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal is to significantly outperform current solutions in terms 
        of MRI-safety (no heating effects), MRI-compatibility (no imaging artifacts) and mechanical stability. The project officially 
        starts on February 1, 2023.

      date: May 20, 2022
      body: |
        Today, TI Solutions released a demo of the final prototype device for advanced research in temporal interference brain stimulation.
        The device, developed in collaboration with the IT’IS Foundation, delivers high-precision current on eight channels from 0 Hz to 
        100 kHz. In the next few weeks the team will finalize the documentation, obtain electrical safety certification, and 
        define the end-to-end testing protocol to be applied for each device. In parallel, the IT’IS Foundation will be completing 
        an example of the control and monitoring software and the TI planning tool.

    for temporal interference (TI) research. The company was founded in December 2019 in Zurich, Switzerland, 
    by the creators of the TI concept in collaboration with <a href="https://www.z43.swiss/" target="_blank" >Z43</a> 
    to specifically foster TI research.

- title: TI Devices
  body: |
   The TIBS-R and TIBS-R-MRI neurostimulation devices support direct current (DC), alternating current and TI stimulation, 
   up to 8 synchronous stimulation channels, a wide carrier-frequency range (DC – 100 kHz), sinusoidal to arbitrary modulation, 
   synchronization with external triggers, compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram recordings, and more. 
   
- title: TI Solutions Early Adopter Program (EAP)
  closed: true
  teaser: TI Solutions aims to facilitate research into TI-based applications. We are pulling together a select group of researchers as part of our Early Adopter Program who are interested in applying our investigational TI stimulation device as part of their research studies. 
  button: Details
  body: |
   <h4>What is the TI Solutions EAP?</h4>
   The EAP will play a pivotal role in fostering exploration of the potential of TI through flexible and highly controlled stimulations. Groups participating in the EAP will be able to use our investigational device in their research projects, enabling them to advance the existing knowledge base through *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies. In turn, TI Solutions will gain insights into the researchers’ needs, which will help drive development and optimization of the specifications for future devices.
   <h4>How can I become part of the EAP?</h4>
   Researchers interested in participating in TI Solutions' EAP should [contact us](mailto:eap@temporalinterference.com) to arrange a conference call for initial discussion before submitting a written proposal. Proposals will be evaluated by the Board of TI Solutions for the scientific significance, topicality, originality, and feasibility of the project. Projects that are approved by the Board enter the EAP.
   
   **Note that each study admitted to the program must provide proof that the study has gained ethics approval from the appropriate regulatory institution as a prerequisite for receiving the TI stimulation device for the proposed research project.**
   
   The final prototype TI devices will become available at the end of April 2022. Groups that are part of the EAP can lease a 4-channel device (the 8-channel device is available on special request) for CHF 500 / month; maintenance and support is included in the lease price. The MRI-compatible version is also available, but at an additional cost of CHF 100 per month. The minimal lease period is six months.
   <h4>Additional Services</h4>
   The <a href="https://www.itis.swiss/" target="_blank" >IT’IS Foundation</a> offers specialized services for the development of experiment-specific graphical user interfaces to support TI planning and simulations and provides guidance on research protocols and experimental design as needed.

- title: TI Planning Tools
  body: |
   The TI planning tools will provide high-quality visualization and optimization of alternating current and 
   TI stimulation configurations based on electromagnetic simulations involving detailed, high-resolution representations 
   of head anatomies of both humans and animals. Thanks to a state-of-the-art cloud-based modeling platform, simulations 
   of complex and realistic setups can be performed without specialized software or hardware. A particular focus is placed 
   on flexibility with regard to optimization criteria (for scientific exploration), good user guidance, and powerful visualization. 
   In 2022, personalized modeling will be added that allows the modeling of any anatomy as well as any electrode shape and placement.
   
- title: Services
  body: |
   Our team will provide all engineering services required for the optimal application of the developed TI devices and 
   planning tools, such as troubleshooting support, replacement of defective devices, and repairs. 
   We are happy to contribute to drafting research proposals and to perform simulations for the TI planning if required. 
   We are also interested in discussing and, if feasible, incorporating additional features into our devices and software tools.
    
- title: The Science
  body: |
   TI stimulation is a noninvasive technique that uses scalp electrodes to apply interfering electrical
   high-frequency currents to reach structures deep inside the brain. While the applied frequencies of the electric fields themselves 
   are too high to induce neural firing, the frequency of the envelop can drive neural activity. This new concept holds great promise 
   for both research and clinics as it may open up new experimental opportunities and may be used for selective deep brain stimulation 
   to treat certain disorders without the necessity of surgically implanting electrodes within certain brain areas, which is still common practice today.
