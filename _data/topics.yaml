      date: Aug 27, 2024
      body: |
        TIBS-R V3.0 has been released! The device is certified for electrical safety according to IEC 60601-1:2005 + A1:2012 + A2:2020 and has several
        important enhancements:<br />
        - Improved performance in the presence of large variations in electrode contact quality<br />
        - Markedly reduced second-order intermodulation products (IM2); when paired with the <a href="https://itis.swiss/s/news-events/news/news/2023-2/new-high-end-filters-for-concurrent-hd-eeg-recording-and-ti-stimulation" target="_blank" >IT’IS electroencephalography (EEG) filter solution</a>, IM2 products are reduced to well below the EEG noise floor (<30nV)<br />
        - New possibilities for EEG-based closed-loop stimulation protocols<br />
        - New wireless charging option that extends stimulator run time, e.g., for overnight experiments
        
        This update will be made available immediately to all researchers in our Early Adopter Program.

   <h4>What is the TI Solutions EAP?</h4>
   The EAP will play a pivotal role in fostering exploration of the potential of TI through flexible and highly controlled stimulations. Groups participating in the EAP will be able to use our investigational device in their research projects, enabling them to advance the existing knowledge base through *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies. In turn, TI Solutions will gain insights into the researchers’ needs, which will help drive development and optimization of the specifications for future devices.
   <h4>How can I become part of the EAP?</h4>
   Researchers interested in participating in TI Solutions' EAP should [contact us](mailto:eap@temporalinterference.com) to arrange a conference call for initial discussion before submitting a written proposal. Proposals will be evaluated by our review board for the scientific significance, topicality, originality, and feasibility of the project. Projects that are approved by the board enter the EAP.
   
   **Note that each study admitted to the program must provide proof that the study has gained ethics approval from the appropriate regulatory institution as a prerequisite for receiving the TI stimulation device for the proposed research project.**
   
   The TI devices are continuously improved and their functions extended. Groups that are part of the EAP can lease a 8-channel device for CHF 500 / month; maintenance and support is included in the lease price. Options for MRI-compatibility, additional hardware for EEG compatibilty and for continuous operation using wireless power transfer are available upon special request. The minimal lease period is six months.
   <h4>Additional Services</h4>
   The <a href="https://www.itis.swiss/" target="_blank" >IT’IS Foundation</a> offers specialized services for the development of experiment-specific graphical user interfaces to support TI planning and simulations and provides guidance on research protocols and experimental design as needed.

   We are also interested in discussing and, if feasible, incorporating additional features into our devices and software tools.
    
- title: The Science
  body: |
   TI stimulation is a non-invasive technique that uses scalp electrodes to apply interfering electrical
   high-frequency currents to reach structures deep inside the brain. While the applied frequencies of the electric fields themselves 
   are too high to induce neural firing, the frequency of the envelop can drive neural activity. This new concept holds great promise 
   for both research and clinics as it may open up new experimental opportunities and may be used for selective deep brain stimulation 
   to treat certain disorders without the necessity of surgically implanting electrodes within certain brain areas, which is still common practice today.
