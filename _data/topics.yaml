- title: The Company
  body: |
    TI Solutions AG develops high-quality and flexible stimulation devices and treatment-planning tools 
    for temporal interference (TI) research. The company was founded in December 2019 in Zurich, Switzerland, 
    by the creators of the TI concept in collaboration with <a href="https://www.z43.swiss/" target="_blank" >Z43</a> 
    to specifically foster TI research.

- title: TI Devices
  body: |
   The neurostimulation devices under development will support both alternating current and TI stimulation, 
   multiple stimulation channels, a wide carrier-frequency range, flexible modulation, magnetic resonance imaging 
   and electroencephalogram recording compatibility, and more.

- title: Treatment-Planning Tools
  body: |
   The treatment-planning tools will provide high-quality visualization and optimization of alternating current and 
   TI stimulation configurations based on electromagnetic simulations involving detailed, high-resolution representations 
   of head anatomies of both humans and animals. Thanks to a state-of-the-art cloud-based modeling platform, simulations 
   of complex and realistic setups can be performed without specialized software or hardware. A particular focus is placed 
   on flexibility with regard to optimization criteria (for scientific exploration), good user guidance, and powerful visualization. 
   In 2021, personalized treatment modeling will be added that allows the modeling of any anatomy as well as any electrode shape and placement.
   
- title: Services
  body: |
   Our team will provide all engineering services required for the optimal application of the developed TI devices and 
   treatment-planning tools, such as troubleshooting support, replacement of defective devices, and repairs. 
   We are happy to contribute to drafting research proposals and to perform simulations for the treatment planning if required. 
   We are also interested in discussing and, if feasible, incorporating additional features into our devices and software tools.
    
- title: The Science
  body: |
   Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation is a noninvasive technique that uses scalp electrodes to apply interfering electrical
   high-frequency currents to reach structures deep inside the brain. While the applied frequencies of the electric fields themselves 
   are too high to induce neural firing, the frequency of the envelop can drive neural activity. This new concept holds great promise 
   for both research and clinics as it may open up new experimental opportunities and may be used for selective deep brain stimulation 
   to treat certain disorders without the necessity of surgically implanting electrodes within certain brain areas, which is still common practice today.
